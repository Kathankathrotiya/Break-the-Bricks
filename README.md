# Break-the-Bricks

The Break-the-Bricks Ball Game is a project designed to showcase basic game development concepts using Java and the Swing library. The game includes a customizable map with bricks of different colors, a paddle controlled by the player, and a bouncing ball. The player's goal is to break all the bricks to advance through levels.


## Features
- Dynamic generation of game maps with varying difficulty levels.
- Player-controlled paddle for bouncing the ball.
- Collision detection with bricks, paddle, and game borders.
- Scoring system and level progression.
- Game over and victory conditions with restart and next-level options.

## Description:
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developed the core game logic, including player controls, ball movement, collision detection, scoring, and level progression in the `Gameplay.java` class.
- **Dynamic Map Generation**: Implemented a dynamic map generation system using the `MapGenerator.java` class, allowing for varying difficulty levels and random colors for bricks.
- **User Interface**: Set up the game window and interface using `JFrame` in the `Main.java` class, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Random Color Generation**: Enhanced the visual appeal of the game by implementing random color generation for bricks, creating a vibrant and engaging gameplay experience.
